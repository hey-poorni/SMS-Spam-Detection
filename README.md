# SMS-Spam-Detection

This project focuses on detecting spam messages in SMS texts using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow. It uses a labeled dataset to train a binary classifier that distinguishes between spam and ham (not spam) messages.


Features
Preprocessing of SMS text data

Text tokenization and padding

Neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras

Training and evaluation of the model

Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Prediction on new SMS samples


Requirements
Python 3.7+

TensorFlow 2.x

NumPy

Pandas

scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
